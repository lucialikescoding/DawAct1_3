## Running the tests

This project does not include automated tests, but you can perform manual checks to verify that the repository is functioning correctly.

### Break down into end-to-end tests

You can run some basic Git commands to ensure everything works as expected:


```bash
git status
git log
git branch
git push origin main
```

These commands help confirm that your local and remote repositories are properly synchronized.

### And coding style tests

The project includes a simple `index.html` file that can be opened in your browser.  
You can validate your HTML code using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
